Take the information below and generate a [NAME].instructions.md instructions file in the /.github/instructions directory. Generate an appropriate name for the [NAME] placeholder based on the generated content. Make sure the instructions are concise and not too long. If no information is provided, prompt the user to provide the necessary details about the layer of architecture or coding standards to document.

The .md file should have frontmatter with a description property that informs copilot of when to use the instructions.
